				<p>
					Founded in 2010, our animal shelter has been dedicated to rescuing and rehoming cats in need. Over
					the years, we have grown from a small group of volunteers to a well-established organization with a
					network of foster homes and a dedicated team of staff and volunteers. Our shelter provides a safe
					haven for cats of all ages, from kittens to seniors, and we work tirelessly to ensure they receive
					the care and love they deserve.
				</p>
				<h2 class="font-bold text-teal-500 h3">Our Mission</h2>
				<p>
					Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats in need. We believe that every cat deserves
					a chance at a happy and healthy life, and we are committed to providing the best possible care for
					our feline friends. We work closely with local communities to promote responsible pet ownership and
					to educate the public about the importance of spaying and neutering.
				</p>
				<h2 class="font-bold text-teal-500 h3">Get Involved</h2>
				<p>
					There are many ways to get involved with our shelter. Whether you are interested in adopting a cat,
					volunteering your time, or making a donation, we welcome your support. Together, we can make a
					difference in the lives of cats in need. Thank you for being a part of our community and for helping
					us to achieve our mission.
