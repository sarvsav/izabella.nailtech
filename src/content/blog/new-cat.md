We're excited to introduce Luna, the newest resident at our cat shelter! Luna is a beautiful and affectionate cat who has quickly won the hearts of our staff and volunteers.

## About Luna

Luna is a two-year-old domestic shorthair with striking green eyes and a sleek black coat. She was found as a stray and brought to our shelter by a kind-hearted individual. Despite her rough start, Luna is incredibly friendly and loves to be around people.

## Luna's Journey

When Luna first arrived, she was a bit shy and unsure of her surroundings. With patience and care from our dedicated team, she has blossomed into a confident and playful cat. Luna enjoys lounging in sunny spots, chasing feather toys, and getting gentle head scratches.

## Ready for Adoption

Luna is now ready to find her forever home. She would do well in a calm and loving environment where she can continue to thrive. If you're looking for a loyal and loving companion, Luna might be the perfect match for you.
